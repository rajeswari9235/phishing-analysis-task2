|  Suspicious Link   | Hovered link goes to `verification-alert.com`, not PayPal                   |
|  Urgent Tone       | “Complete verification within 24 hours to avoid suspension”                 |
|  Malicious Attachment | Attached `secure_account.html` could mimic a login form                  |
|  Generic Greeting  | Uses “Dear Customer” instead of user's name                                 |
|  Header Check      | Analyzer shows mismatch between `Return-Path` and `From:` (spoofing)        |
